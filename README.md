# -Destruction
Destruction is an application in which fireballs from the sky will fall and will hit the ground.
The user when presses the keys <w> and <x>, ground will be rotated to x-axis, with keys <a> and <d>
ground will be rotated to z-axis and with keys <+> και <-> ground will be zoomed in/out.
When the user presses the <b> key, a fireball will appear in a random spot.
The ball moves towards the ground with constant speed and when it hits the ground, there is an 
explosion and the ball is lost.In the spot of the ground where the explosion occurred, a “crater” appears.
With the space key the application terminates.The program is in C++/C with the use of Opengl 3.3+.
GLFW, GLEW and GLM libraries and Visual Studio 2022 were used.
This project was done in collaboration with one fellow student.
